# Monopoly Digital Banking
---
### What is it?
Monopoly Digital Banking, or MDP, is meant to be a digital way of handling cash in Monopoly.
It will give each user a PIN for authenticating transactions, so two players cant steal another
players money during an unrelated transaction.

### How do you use it?
1. Launch the application.
2. Set a bankers PIN. This will be used to authenticate all transactions involving the bank.
3. Enter how many players there are
4. Enter information for each player. Each player must enter their own PIN and keep it a secret from everyone, including the banker.
5. You're all setup, you can start the game. All players have already been given the starting amount of money.
Use the wiki to find more information on using the software.

### For Commiters
For more information on committing, go to the wiki.
This is what I would like others to help with
- GUI
- A web interface so other players can connect from their phones and manage their money
- Unlimited players
